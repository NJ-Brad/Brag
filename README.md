# Brag

This application can be quite useful when it is time to write your periodic self-review.  

A record of all of your wins will allow you to pick the ones that best reflect your performance.

The problem has aways been recording them.  You remember them all?  Yeah right!

You can record them on One Note or Word, or write them in a notebook.  All of these have "friction" making it less likely that you will record your wins, consistently.  

This application allows quick and simple recording of your wins.  

It was also an experiment in working with the constraints that are a console application, instead of a desktop or web application.
